<h1>Covid Project</h1>
 
<p>This project puts in practice how to connect to public APIs, how to extract some data from it and then send it back to a webpage.</p>

<p>In this case, the calls to the APIs are done based on user's input. The user can search for Covid-19 Statistics for any given country.</p>
